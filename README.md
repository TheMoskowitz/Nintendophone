# Nintendophone
A musical instrument you can play as you would a video game.

You can see the Nintendophone in action and get a description of how it works here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTQomh0gtog) and there's more information on my webpage (http://www.jeffmoskowitz.com/engineering).

The Nintendophone uses an arcade joystick, four buttons, a missile launch switch, an arduino and an arduino musical instrument shield. I housed it in a makerbox made out of perspex that I cut and engraved with a laser cutter.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
